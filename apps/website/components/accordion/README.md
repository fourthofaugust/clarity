::: summary
An accordion is a collection of vertically stacked sections with multiple content areas which may be expanded or minimized by the user to reveal their content.
:::

## Usage

An accordion allows generic content to be collapsed and allows users to expand to show more detail. This is useful when the set of information is large or you want to enable users to reveal more complex or less frequently used data as necessary.

<!-- [//]: # Anatomy - Accordions consist of a panel with a **title**, a **caret**, and **content**. The **title** is **13px Clarity City medium**, and content (default) is **14px Clarity City regular**. The selected panel header is highlighted when open. -->

<!-- [//]: # Q: How does the panel highlight behave when multiple open panels is enabled? -->

## Behavior

Accordions expand and collapse showing / hiding the data in a section when the user clicks on the panel header. Accordions by default only allow one panel to be open at a time. Multiple open panels are an available implementation option.

## Placement

Accordions are designed for use in the main content area.

## Content

Keep text as brief as possible especially in header sections which should convey the nature of the content without overflow
